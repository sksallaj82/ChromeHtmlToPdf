## What is ChromeHtmlToPdf?

ChromeHtmlToPdf is a 100% managed C# .NET library and console application that can be used to convert HTML to PDF format with the use of Google Chrome

## Why did I make this?

I needed a replacement for wkHtmlToPdf, a great tool but the activity on this project is low and it's not 100% compatible with HTML5.
